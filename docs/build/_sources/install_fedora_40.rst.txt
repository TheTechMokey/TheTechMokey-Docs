Select Your Release
--------------------

Unlike Windows, there are many releases. You can do some research on these at https://fedoraproject.org/spins/

Personally, I use Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop. But for this guide, we will be working with the official release of Fedora Workstation.

You will notice a checkmark on the drive that you want to install on. If it's not checked, click it so it is.

Storage Configuration
---------------------

For this guide, we will not be talking about RAID configuration. So for now, click "Automatic."

You can choose to encrypt your drive... or not.

.. note:: 

    Encrypting your data will require setting a password that will be entered after the boot process and before reaching the OS.

Click "Done" at the top left.

You will be brought back to the installation summary.

Select "Begin Installation."

This will start the installation.

Once complete, click "Finish Installation."

    If you encrypted your hard drive, do not use the same password. It only makes sense.

Take a tour if you'd like, or skip the tour and get down to it.
