Welcome to my corner of the digital world! With over 15 years of IT experience, I've journeyed from building my first computer at age 10 to leading network operations for major government projects. My expertise spans network architecture, cybersecurity, programming, and project management.

My career highlights include supervising network operations for a government agency, where I managed IPv6 transitions and network security. As a network administrator, I handled Cisco security systems and maintained nationwide network operations. My time with a local municipality saw me implementing a 10G network ring and managing IT infrastructure for emergency services.

I started my programming journey with languages like C#, C++, and Java, creating custom applications and managing databases. My freelance work allowed me to develop tailored solutions for various clients. My military service as a Combat Engineer honed my leadership and communication skills, which I continue to apply in my IT roles.

This website centralizes my accumulated knowledge and experiences, offering valuable insights and resources for anyone navigating the dynamic IT landscape. Dive in and discover the wealth of information that can help you on your own tech journey!
